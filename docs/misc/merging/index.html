    <h2>Merging</h2>

    <p>
      This article isn't about how to install mods as mods tend to
      have different installation processes. Instead this article will focus on what
      is often considered the most complex part: <b>script merging</b>.
    </p>

    <h3>Why do you need to merge</h3>

    <p>
      The game has exposed scripts, a good portion
      of the source code used to make the game and its logic, is in a folder located
      in <span>/content/content0</span>. This means that it is possible for someone to copy the script
      and its folder path and change the code resulting in parts of the games logic/code being changed 
      Let's say you would want to change the <span>content0/gameplay/playerwitcher.ws</span> file, you
      would then create a mod in the mods folder with the same path <span>/gameplay/playerwitcher.ws</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      This method has an issue, if two mods change the same file then
      only one of the mods will get its changes load by the game, the other one will be completely ignored.
      The solution is to merge the scripts of all the mods that edit the file into a single new mod that will
      be loaded before everyone else. This will ensure everyone's changes will be included and loaded.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is it so complicated</h3>

    <p>
      Short answer: because code is complicated. <br/>
      The long answer is that the scriptmerger is already doing an insane
      job. Of course it is not perfect, and new better solutions could be developped
      (i am personally working on one but it may take months to come), but it offers
      an intuitive and easy to understand interface that anyone can use to compare
      different versions of a code file. And even with a better tool you would still
      have to do some manual merging at some point.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can learn a few things that will make your merging life much easier.
      You can't learn how to read code in a few minutes or hours but you can learn
      a few things you should look for to avoid compiling errors like these:
    </p>

    <i>hold click to see larger image</i>

    <p>
      As you can see the errors are always under this format : <span>Error [origin of the error]path/to/the/file/with/error.ws(line number): And the error</span>.
      From them you can learn a lot, by looking at the origin of the error between the <span>[]</span>
      you can learn which mod causes the errors. Here in the example we see it comes
      from the merges and from the file <span>playerwitcher.ws</span>. So without
      looking at the error itself we already know which file we should maybe re-merge
    </p>

    <p>
      You may also have noticed a <span>warning</span> below the error
      Warnings generally of less concern than errors and the game can function with them
    </p>

    <h3>Basic merging guide</h3>

    <p>
      Merging scripts through kdiff (Script Merger's merging program) comes down 
      to picking the right line of code from one mod or another.
      You are offered three script versions, the vanilla scripts, mod Bs scripts and mod Cs scripts.
      It is up to you to pick either A if you want vanilla, B or C. Picking one doesn't stop
      you from picking another. You can pick both A & B, or B & C etc... You should know
      that you should rarely pick A as it is vanilla, and you're merging mods for a reason
      because you don't want vanilla.
    </p>

    <img src="merging-full-view.png" alt="">

    <p>
      The three views at the top are A, B and C as said earlier. And the view at the 
      bottom is the result. What matters most here is how the result looks and you should
      pick accordingly.
    </p>

    <img src="script-merger-buttons.png" alt="">

    <p>
      For each conflict, you should use the A, B, C buttons to pick the version of
      the code you want. Then you use the arrow buttons to move from one conflict to another.
      In the image you can see both B and C were picked. And there is no other conflict
      in the current file. You can now close the window safely
    </p>

    <h3>Important stuff when merging</h3>

    <p>
      This part is about stuff you should watch for in the code. You're not supposed
      to understand exactly what the code does, but the compiler expects the code
      to be formatted correctly or else you will get errors like shown above in the article.
      There are important things that are common causes for errors among non software developers,
      here is a list of them
    </p>

    <p>
      For every <span>{</span> comes a <span>}</span>.
      <div class="spoiler" id="brace-example">
        <a href="#show-brace-example">hide</a>
        Here is an valid example:
        <pre>
          if (thePlayer.GetLevel() > 10)
          <span>{</span>
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(10, 10, 10));
          <span>}</span>
        </pre>
        And here is an invalid one
        <pre>
          for (i = 0; i < npc_list.Size(); i += 1)
          <span>{</span>
            npc.SetLevel((i + 2) / 5);
          
        </pre>
      </div>
      <a href="#brace-example" id="show-brace-example" class="spoiler-show">show</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      A line that starts with <span>else</span> cannot follow another line that
      starts with an <span>else</span> too. And should also follow a previous <span>if</span>
      statement. It should not follow it closely but still, you should not see an <span>else</span>
      without an <span>if</span>
      <div class="spoiler" id="else-example">
        <a href="#show-else-example">hide</a>
        Here is a valid example:
        <pre>
          <span>if</span> (thePlayer.GetLevel() > 10)
          {
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(10, 10, 10));
          }
          <span>else</span>
          {
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(50, 50, 50));
          }

          <span>if</span> (thePlayer.GetLevel() > 10)
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(10, 10, 10));
          <span>else</span> 
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(50, 50, 50));
        </pre>
        and here is an invalid example
        <pre>
          <span>if</span> (thePlayer.GetLevel() > 10)
          {
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(10, 10, 10));
          }
          <span>else</span>
          {
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(50, 50, 50));
          }
          <span>else</span>
          {
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(100, 100, 100));
          }

          <span>if</span> (thePlayer.GetLevel() > 10)
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(10, 10, 10));
          <span>else</span> 
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(50, 50, 50));
          <span>else</span> 
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(100, 100, 100));
        </pre>
      </div>
      <a href="#else-example" id="show-else-example" class="spoiler-show">show</a>      
    </p>

    <p>
      For every <span>/*</span> comes a <span>*/</span>.
      <div class="spoiler" id="comment-example">
        <a href="#show-comment-example">hide</a>

        Here is a valid example:
        <pre>
          if (thePlayer.GetLevel() > 10)
          {
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(10, 10, 10));
          }
          /*
          els
          {
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(50, 50, 50));
          }
          */
        </pre>
        and here is an invalid one
        <pre>
          if (thePlayer.GetLevel() > 10)
          {
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(10, 10, 10));
          }
          /*
          else
          {
            thePlayer.TeleportWithRotation(Vector(50, 50, 50));
          }
        </pre>
      </div>
      <a href="#comment-example" id="show-comment-example" class="spoiler-show">show</a>
