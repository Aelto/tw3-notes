    <h3>The author</h3>

    <p>
      You can skip this part if you don't care about who i am. I'm not going to
      present myself, but instead i plan to show who i am in the modding community
      to prove that i'm not completely ignorant. Although you should not consider
      this article as the one and only guide to modding, but instead you should
      see it as one new article on the subject.
    </p>

    <p>
      I [Aeltoth] am the author of a few script based mods:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5018">Random Encounters Reworked</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5312">Combat Skills</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5766">Automatic Dialog Picker</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5494">Resources & Perks Overhaul</a></li>
        <li>plus a few others mods...</li>
      </ul>
      
      Coding stuff is my thing, i don't do texture mods, i don't do UI mods, only script mods.
      That's why this guide will explain how to install script mods. Which is a good thing
      because once you understand how to install a script mod, you understand how
      to install any type of mod.
    </p>

  <section id="vocabulary">
    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>

    Any specific term this article will use is written here. It is important to
    understand most of them.

    <ul>
      <li>The <span>game directory</span> is where you installed The Witcher 3</li>
      <li>A <span>mod</span> is what modifies the game</li>
      <li>A <span>dlc</span> adds content to the game</li>
      <li>A <span>menu</span>, often paired with a mod allows you tweak values inside the mod</li>
      <li>A <span>script</span> is always inside a <span>mod</span>. This is the code for this mod.</li>
      <li>A <span>merge</span> is the resulting <span>script</span> of two combined <span>mods</span></li>
      <li>A <span>script-merger</span> is a little tool whose job is to simplify the merging process.
        It will detect what needs merging, it will even merge them for you. But it's not perfect, sometimes
        if two mods modify the same part of the game, it will create...
      </li>
      <li>A <span>conflict</span>, it's when the script-merger you used could not determine
        which version to pick. Should it use mod A or mod B if both touch the same part of
        the game? He can't decide for you and will then ask you to decide.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="requirements">
    <h3>Requirements</h3>

    <p>
      You will need a few tools to install mods. Some of them are not necessary
      but you may waste hours if you don't use them.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h4>The game and its version</h4>

      <p>
        some mods, or even guides, will ask you to downgrade the version of your game
        to "ensure better compatibilty". You should know this is completely wrong
        because there is no difference between the latest version <span>1.32</span>
        and the one often claimed to be more compatible <span>1.31</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I personally checked by doing a git-diff (a tool made for spotting differences
        two versions of a software). The only change from the two versions was the move
        of a 5 lines function from one file to another. From my point of view it's
        a change they forgot to ship with 1.31 and chose to wait for 1.32 because
        the fact this function is in file A instead of B makes literally no difference.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only difference between those two versions is the added chinese support.
        So save yourself an hour and don't downgrade.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>The tools</h4>
      
      <h5>Mod manager</h5>
      <p>
        The Witcher 3 is a game that was not developped with modding in mind, this means
        that modding the game is much more rustic and complex than other games like Skyrim
        or Valheim. It is so complex that the few mod managers you can find for the game
        cannot realistically handle all the steps you'd have to do when installing mods.
        This creates an a big issue, mod managers will someone stop working correctly and will
        cause mayhem in your current modlist.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the reason i will suggest you <b>not</b> to use a mod manager and
        instead rely on your good old brain. The fact a mod manager will fail one
        out of the two cases adds so much randomness to the process it is simpler
        to do it manually. With mod managers you will have to learn the worflow of the
        manager but also know the manual workflow to confirm it did not break your
        game.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not an enjoyable modding experience.
      </p>

      <h5>Script Merger</h5>
      <p>
        The only tool you will need as a mod user is a <span>script-merger</span>.
        If you're wondering what a script merger is, please read the <a href="#vocabulary">Vocabulary</a> section.
        The mod used script merger is this one: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/484">Script Merger on NexusMods</a>.
        If you want an alternative that is open-source, you could use <a href="https://github.com/Aelto/tw3-script-merger">my implementation</a>
        of a script merger. But it won't be as good & intuitive as the first one i linked.
      </p>

      <h5>Mod limit</h5>
      <p>
        As i said earlier the game was not made with mods in mind, and you will quickly notice that. After you've
        installed a few mods, you will hit what is known as the <span>mod limit</span>.
        Once you reach the limit, sometimes after 10 mods, sometimes after only 1, the game
        will randomly get stuck during loading screens.
      </p>

      <p>
        To fix that inconvenient issue, you need to patch the executable with a
        <span>mod limit fix</span>. You can find such a tool here: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3643">Mod limit fix on NexusMods</a>
      </p>

      <h5>The most important tool</h5>
      <p>
        <b>Patience</b>. Every minute you'll save by not reading the install instructions
        of a mod will be this time multiplied by ten trying to fix the mess you
        made in your game. Or this could be said differently, take a minute of two
        to read the install instructions to save you hours of troubleshooting.
      </p>

      <p>
        My mods comment sections (and not only mine, all of them) are filled with
        people asking questions that were answered in the documentation. They had
        to wait ten hours only to be redirected to the documentation, where they eventually
        solved their issues by doing what they could have done at the start.
      </p>
    </section>

  <section id="installing">
    <h2>Installing</h2>

    <p>
      Now that you have your tools all setup you can start installing mods. To
      guide you through the process i picked three mods i think will be perfect candidates.
      Not because they're cool mods but because one is big in terms of scripts and includes
      a menu, the second is small but includes scripts, a dlc, and a menu. And the third
      one is big, contains scripts, DLCs and menus and most importantly it has a high
      chance to create <span>conflicts</span> during the <span>merge</span>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/365">Friendly HUD</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3369">Loot Economy Gear Overhaul</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5312">Combat Skills</a></li>
      </ul>

      From there, you are not expected to follow along but the article will do as
      if.
    </p>

    <h3>Download</h3>
    <p>
      Start by downloading the mods. The three mods we picked are simple, they
      are not split in two, all well organised in single zip archives. But you may
      have noticed different with Friendly HUD. It has a requirement, or a dependency
      as we call it in software development. It means Friendly HUD won't work without
      its dependency: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3652">Community Patch - Base</a>,
      so download it as well.
    </p>

    <h3>Community patches and Shared mods</h3>
    <p>
      It's important we talk about these mods. You may be wondering why would a mod
      have a dependency, the mod author could just include the other mod with his mod.
      Including a mod with another mod creates many issues, let's say both mod B and C
      require mod A. If both B and C included A, you'd find yourself with two versions
      of A installed in your game. The script merger would then see conflicts everywhere
      because both mod have the change edits in the script and you're not spending
      hours resolving all of the conflicts.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's where depenencies like the community patches and sharedutils shine, when
      a mod uses one of them you know it will at least be compatible with other mods
      that also depend on these. Also once you have installed a shared mod once, you
      no longer have to install it for the other mods that need it. It makes mod management
      simpler.
    </p>

    <h3>Installing the mods</h3>
    <p>
      Let's start by the simplest of the three: Combat Skills. Navigate into the
      archive until you see three folders: <span>mods</span>, <span>dlc</span> and <span>bin</span>.
      Installing a mod when the folders are organised like this is dead simple, open the
      <span>game directory</span> and drop the three folders directly into your game
      directory folder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Combat skills is now installed. You could launch the game now and everything
      should work as expected.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now for a more complicated one: Friendly HUD. The way Ghost (the author of FHUD)
      packs her mod is a bit different than the others but it is still pretty simple.
      Open the archive and you will see a folder named <span>modFriendlyHUD</span>, 
      because it starts with <span>mod</span> you know it should be dropped into your
      <span>mods</span> folder inside your <span>game directory</span>.
      <br/>
      Once you have done that open the modFriendlyHUD folder and you will notice a <span>bin</span>
      folder in it, if you remember how we did for CombatSkills you should already know what to do.
      Bin folders are supposed to be dropped into your game directory as well, so take
      it and drop it inside your game directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now is a good time to remind you to read the install instructions of the mods
      you are installing, especially the Friendly HUD ones. Friendly HUD needs
      the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3652">Community Patch - Base</a> to
      work. So download it and open the archive, you will see two folders in it: <span>mods</span> and
      <span>content</span>. This is again the same process, drop these two folders inside
      your game directory. Accept when prompted to replace a file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's move on to the third mod: LEGO. This one is a bit different because it is
      actually a collection of mods. But you will see it is again the same process: three
      folders <span>mods</span>, <span>bin</span>, <span>dlc</span> that you need to
      drop into your game folder.
      <br />
      And that's it.

    <h2>Installing mods, a quick recap</h2>

    <p>
      A quick recap of the last section with a list of the main principles:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Before installing a mod, read the install instructions to see if it needs any dependency.
          If it needs a dependency, download it as well and read its instructions too and apply
          the same principles to the dependency.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the archive contains any the following folder:
          <ul>
            <li><span>mods</span></li>
            <li><span>bin</span></li>
            <li><span>dlc</span></li>
            <li><span>content</span></li>
          </ul>
          drop the folder(s) in your game directory
        </li>
        <li>
          If the archive contains a folder that starts with <span>mod</span>,drop
          that folder insinde the <span>mods</span> folder
        </li>
        <li>
          If the archive contains a folder that starts with <span>dlc</span>,drop
          that folder insinde the <span>dlc</span> folder
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
